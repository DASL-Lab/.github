# DASL Lab: Data-driven Advancements in Statistical Learning

Current projects:

- Proportions of variants of concern in wastewater samples space and time
  - Estimation of the proportions using GLM and ML methods
  - Estimation of the *variants* using unsupervised/clustering methods
  - Analysis of residuals for reconstructions of wastewater mutations data
  - Determination of the "correct" number of wastewater sampling sites
- Habitat utililization using DBSCAN
  - Modifications to the algorithm based on the structure of the data
- Sports analytics projects TBD
- Wildland fire projects TBD
